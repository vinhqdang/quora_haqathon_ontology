# Quora Haqathon Ontology

My solution (not the best one) for [the competition](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/quora-haqathon/challenges/ontology)

I tried to avoid duplication with existing solutions on the Internet. Some of them: [#1](https://github.com/Nithanaroy/QuoraChallenges-Ontology), [#2](https://github.com/justinshi/Ontology).

I tried to not use any special libraries, i.e. no import statement.
